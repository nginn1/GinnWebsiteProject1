<h3>The 2023 Phasmophobia Halloween Update Does Not Dissapoint</h3>
<p>The latest spooky event in Phasmophobia is the Halloween update. It added some minor fixes and changes but also incorporated a great little quest to complete and doing so earns you a nice trophy for your lobby. 
This event requires the player to go through all the maps listed with a little pumpkin on their thumbnails. This locations have a pumpkin hidden somewhere on the map with a small folded note in its mouth. 
These notes give a piece by piece recipe that you'll use later on. Take note of the ingredients listed as there is no other way to review them without going back and finding them again so I recommend taking a picture 
of them or writing them down as you go along. once you've found all of them, you will then make your way to the Maple Lodge Campsite map. Maple Lodge has gotten a full on remodel in this update but don't worry pretty 
much all of your favorite easter eggs from before are still present. You will see a large plume of green smoke to your left once entering the map. This is a cauldron where you will plop in all of the ingredients you find. 
To find them, you need to search the map. Pay attention to the images that were given on the recipe cards as they make the search a little easier since the ingredient names are a little metaphorical. Once you've found all 
of the ingredients make your way to the cauldron and drop them in. An event will then trigger and now you can just sit back and watch because you ar enow done. once returning to the lobby you will see a cut little trophy on 
one of the shelves lining the back wall. This event was great the changes to Maple Lodge are nice, the event was fun, and the new atmosphere of the lobby gives the player a very nice spooky feel that is perfect for Halloween.<br>10/10 </p>
