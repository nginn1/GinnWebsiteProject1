<h1>The Top 10 Games of the Year!</h1>

<dl>
<dt>1.Luigi's Mansion</dt>
<dd>Luigi's Mansion is a great game much like resident evil where you traverse a big spooky mansion and find keys to get to the end, except with cute ghosts and you suck them up with a vaccum instead of shooting them. 10/10</dd>
<dt>2. Zelda</dt>
<dd>Zelda is pretty though to be honest not as good as Donkey Kong but still pretty good. 10/10</dd>
<dt>3. Fallout</dt>
<dd> Fallout is a really good game with tons to do and places to explore. Highl recommended game. 9/10</dd>
<dt>4. Kirby</dt>
<dd>Running around as a tiny pink ball and sucking up bad guys is really fun, you should try it. 8/10</dd>
<dt>5. Animal Crossing</dt>
<dd>This is a game that took me a while to get into but it's very relaxing and rewarding when you really put the time into it. 8/10</dd>
<dt>6. Halo</dt>
<dd>I've never actually played this game but I heard it was really good. 7/10</dd>
<dt>7. Star Wars</dt>
<dd>I made this game up but there are plenty of star wars games on the market for you to enjoy so just pick one. ??/10 </dd>
<dt>8. Nintendogs</dt>
<dd>This is only at 8 on this list because I couldn't get a shih-tzu. 7/10</dd>
<dt>9. Oblivion</dt>
<dd>This game is great a lot like fallout but in a midievil fantasy world. The people are scary looking though. 7/10</dd>
<dt>10. Starfield</dt>
<dd>Another game like Fallout and Oblivion but this time in space! You can build and fly ships, visit tons of different planets and fight bad guys. Good game. 7/10</dd>
